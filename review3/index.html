          A visualization of known and tracked Near Earth Asteroids, or NEAs
          that will make a close approach to Earth within the next 12 months, or
          have made a close approach within the last 12 months, as tracked by
          NASA's JPL NEO program. Many NEAs aren't discovered until they've
          nearly passed us in their orbit of the sun, which is why one side of
          this graph is so much more populated than the other. The view in our
          rear-view mirror is better than the one through our windsheild.

          Our vision is to facilitate the on-going scientific discovery process
          and inspire the public through the body of knowledge captured in these
          public archives. Through this topic we are trying to answer two
          essential questions:- How many past missions? What countries have
          contributed and how much they have contributed over the years??

        <h1>Possibility of life on Exoplanets.</h1>
        <p>
          Life on an exoplanet that orbits a star is possible when its distance
          from its star is accurate for heat and light, where the atmosphere is
          also thick enough, water is present and oxygen is also present. A
          recent study has found that planets that are tilted to one side while
          orbiting the star are more likely to have more advanced and complex
          life.
